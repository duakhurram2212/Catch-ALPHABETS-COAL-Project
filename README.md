# Catch-ALPHABETS-COAL-Project
"Catch the falling alphabets before they hit the ground!"  CatchAlphabets is an interactive game built in Assembly Language for DOSBox. Players control a moving box at the bottom of the screen to catch randomly falling alphabets (A-Z). The box can be moved left or right using arrow keys (or 'A'/'D' keys in multiplayer mode).
